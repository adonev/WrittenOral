## Books

### Strongly Recommended
* _Stylish Academic Writing,_ by Helen Sword.   
This book is what I will base class on, to give you techniques to write elegantly and stylishly. It is an easy, fun read. Available [online](https://getit.library.nyu.edu/go/9442159) with an NYU connection. You can read it at your own time. 

### Other Resources
* _The Elements of Style,_ by Strunk and White.   
A classic style manual, and a good way to revise English grammar. Freely available from a number of sources including [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37134).
* _Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace,_ by Joseph M. Williams and Joseph Bizup. 12th Ed.   
Recommended because you will want to refer to this text over and over in the future.
* _Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences,_ by Nicholas J. Higham.   
Available [online](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719550) at with an NYU connection. 
* _The Sense of Style,_ by Steven Pinker.  
This lovely book gives many entertaining examples of good and bad writing, and shows the cognitive science behind what makes prose easier or harder to understand. 

## Tools

Each of you will be required to write a "paper"/"lecture note" in LaTex. You should setup a working [LaTex environment](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (for OS X use [MACTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) and consider installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)) on the computing system you wish to use for this course (the Linux-based CIMS networked computers have everything you need and more). First-time LaTex users (but also others!) should consider using the WYSIWYG Latex frontend / word processor [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) to start. Students that prefer to work directly with LaTex should take a look at some latex-specific editors, such as the free and portable [TeXMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index.html) or (my preference) [TeXstudio](https://texstudio.org/) (installed on Courant's linux network). More experienced users could use a programming editor that is latex-aware, such as [atom-latex](https://atom.io/packages/latex) or [LaTeXTools-sublime](https://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 If you want to make presentations in PowerPoint or keynote and include equations, try [LatexIt](https://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/) (comes with MACTex on OS X systems), or the [IguanaTex PowerPoint plugin](https://www.jonathanleroux.org/software/iguanatex/).
 
To co-edit and comment on the written samples as a group, we will use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), and maybe [github](https://github.com/)+TeX editor of choice (github is integrated with Overleaf pretty nicely).
