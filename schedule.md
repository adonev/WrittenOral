## 2/1 [Basic oral presentation skills](Lecture-MS-1.pdf)

Writing a talk is covered in Chapter 9 in the textbook by Higham. Also look at these tips on the [David Attenborough style of scientific presentation from Will Ratcliff](David-Attenborough.pdf). Watch it in action in this [5-minute lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGHr6MHapo) from Ratcliff.

### Pre-class materials

1.  A short video lesson ["How Big is Infinity?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYKcOFQCeno)" by TedEd.
2.  A lecture on TED on the ["Mathematics of origami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYKcOFQCeno). Watch on your own and comment in class.
3.  A mathematical conference lecture on a very technical topic of [Operads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZquD_VRDFoU) (algebraic geometry).
4.  A [5 minute talk on the rise of multicellular life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGHr6MHapo) related to the [David Attenborough style](http://nrmscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/David-Attenborough-talk-technique-2018.pdf).

**Elevator statements** are discussed on page 154 in Chapter 13 (The Big Picture) of the book Stylish Academic Writing. Here is what Sword has to say about it:
_'Condensing a complex research project into a pithy abstract is no simple task, to be sure. An even greater challenge is to boil that abstract down into an “elevator statement”: the seemingly off-the-cuff but in fact brilliantly polished single-sentence sum- mary that you offer to the colleague who turns to you in the elevator at an academic conference and asks, “So what are you working on?” You have just a minute or two to respond: the time that it takes for the elevator to arrive at its destination floor...The secret ingredient of an effective elevator statement—or, for that matter, of a persuasive abstract, article, or book—is a strong thesis or argument. Both words are frequently heard in the freshman composition classroom but seldom in the research laboratory. However, identical principles apply in both venues: writers who put forth a bold, defensible claim are much more likely to generate engaging, persuasive prose than those who of- fer bland statements of fact with which no one could possibly disagree. In the sciences and social sciences, a strong thesis fol- lows naturally from a compelling research question...'_

### Assignment

Prepare a 2-3min elevator talk. Choose your topic (e.g., your own research, field of math) and audience. Try one more specialized and one less specialized audience (e.g., a colleague and a neighbor). Present in class for comment.
