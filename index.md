# Course Overview

To see materials from prior years this seminar has been taught as a full course (it used to include teaching as well as writing), see pages for [Spring 2018](https://cims.nyu.edu/~donev/Teaching/WrittenOral/#student-papers) and [Spring 2020](https://modelingsimulation.github.io/TeachingWriting2020/#final-reports).

## Course Description
Communication, both oral and written, is essential in academic careers and beyond. This course aims to help graduate students in mathematics develop skills to more effectively communicate their discipline and their research through writing and oral presentation. This half course (1.5 credits) will focus on academic writing and presentations, and will help students understand the “logic” of writing so as to construct clearer prose both at the sentence, paragraph, and article level. Throughout, the course will pay attention to how skills from both of these areas transfer to creating clearer, more engaging research presentations.

This seminar-style course will be highly interactive, with much of the learning occurring through feedback from other students. Students are expected to actively participate during the course time, and to complete several assignments including observing a class, teaching a short class, writing a research report and completing shorter writing exercises.

## Expectations
Students enrolled in this course will be expected to attend the class meetings and participate fully in the discussions and activities. Students will also be expected to complete approximately one hour of work outside of class each week. This work will include reading and writing assignments, preparing presentations as well as classroom observations. For more detail on assignments, see the [Course Schedule](schedule.md).

Postdocs are encouraged to  audit the course for professional development. Auditors will be expected to prepare for class by doing the assigned reading, and to participate fully in discussions and in-class activies. Auditors will not be ask to submit written assignments.
